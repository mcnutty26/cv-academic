## Research Interests

The modern connected home can be a busy and confusing space. My research uses a diverse set of methodologies to understand the concerns that people have when they use smart/connected devices, both for themselves and their families. This insight is used to develop solutions and design artefacts that empower people to take control of their privacy and autonomy, allowing them to shape their usage of technology to better support them.

I wish to continue exploring questions about the nature of people's understandings of and concerns about digital technology; fundamentally, what is it that makes people uneasy about using these systems, and what can be done to mitigate concerns both now and in the future? So far there has been a natural focus in my work on privacy as the most prevalent amongst these concerns, but a complete understanding requires the consideration of others such as autonomy, transparency, and the social order of the home.

## Projects
`2021 - 2023`
__Secure AI Assistants__, EPSRC
SAIS (Secure AI assistantS) is a cross-disciplinary collaboration providing an understanding of attacks on the AI assistant ecosystem. It will explore the feasibility and severity of potential attacks from a strategic threat and risk approach, methods to specify & verify the security behaviour of AIS, and the generation of co-created security explanations for AIS behaviour.

`2019 - 2020`
__Informing the Future of Data Protection in Smart Homes__, Information Commissioners' Office

In order to better understand people's concerns about digital technology in the home, I led a study where we conducted interviews with a number of HCI experts around the use of respect as a lens for understanding how digital systems should treat people. Based on the outcomes of a six month ethnographic study, I also assisted in the design of a number of speculative prototypes of data protection systems in the home.

`2018-2019`
__Respectful Things in Private Spaces__, EPSRC and Building Research Establishment

I led a study exploring people's perceptions of 'smartness' with respect to connected devices in the home, and how these perceptions relate to ethical concerns about the use of these devices. Drawing on thinking from Kant to the present day, I also conducted a preliminary exploration of how philosophical accounts of respect might be integrated into the design of devices for the smart home.

`2019`
__IoT in the Home Demonstrator__, EPSRC

I led a study exploring privacy-empowering technologies for the connected home, including the development of the Aretha smart home network disaggregator. Aretha analyses and visualises network traffic flows in the home, presenting users with a breakdown of the companies to which their devices send data, as well as their geographic location. Aretha was deployed to three families over a period of six weeks, and was also demonstrated to members of the public at the BRE Watford smart home test bed.
